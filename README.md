# Secure AI API System

This project demonstrates how backend and AI APIs can be protected from abuse using core security controls.

## Features
- API key authentication
- Rate limiting
- Logging and monitoring
- Alerting on suspicious behavior
- Incident response with temporary API key blocking

## Why This Matters
AI APIs are high-value targets. Abuse can lead to financial loss, service disruption, and security risks.
This project simulates real-world API protection logic used in AI systems.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- Linux

## Learning Outcome
Understanding how API abuse is detected, logged, and contained in AI services.
